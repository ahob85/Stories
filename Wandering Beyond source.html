You awaken on your stomach. You are soft and spongy, like you have no bones at all. 

You turn to your back and lift your head to have a good look at yourself (you can't see much beyond yourself anyway). Sure enough, your body is completely unrecognizable to you. Your head, chest, and abdomen remain intact, though their proportions are significantly altered. Your abdomen is oblong, like a sausage, with many horizontal sections, and many tiny "feet". You no longer have two but _six_ limbs attached to your chest. Perhaps the greatest {reveal link: "revelation", text: "realization"} is that you have "tentacles". 

Whatever they did to bring you back to life, you're wondering if it worth transforming you into this... thing. 

Before you can wonder any further, you feel a tremendous pain in your gut. You are _starving_. 

&gt; [[Look for food.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Beginning." tags="" position="1083,757" size="100,100">You hear your impact with the ground before you feel it. It causes a high-pitched {reveal link: "resonance", text: "echo"}, like the ringing of a tiny handbell.

Thankfully, your {reveal link: "consciousness", text: "awareness of your surroundings"} fades at about the same rate that the pain you expected sets in. The ringing grows in volume, gradually drowning out the panicked voices of those whom put you up to climbing the tree. For a moment you humor yourself by wondering if they are coming to your aid or fleeing the scene. Judging by the few statements you can make out - "I'm outta here!" and "Not my fault!" - you go with the latter assumption.

You are {text input for: "playerName"}, but you always wanted to be someone else. Now you're-

_ring... ring... ring..._

After returning to your stomach, you quickly realize you are resting on a giant leaf. A giant _appetizing_ leaf, attached to a plant with {reveal link: "virtually", text: "nearly"} infinite leaves just like it. You take a bite of the leaf and discover that it's absolutely delicious. You've never quite {reveal link: "fancied", text: "liked"} salad without dressing, but this leaf is probably the best meal you've ever had. 

As you swallow the last bit the leaf and prepare to find another, you take note of the giant bird perched atop a nearby branch. It was likely watching you gorge the entire time. 

It's obvious that this bird is a predator, and you are its prey. It means to eat you, or perhaps bring you back to its nest to feed its hungry young. This bird was simply waiting for you to finish your meal first. The fatter, the better.

In one motion, the bird hops from its branch and lands close enough for you to see its menacing, marble-like eyes. You are utterly defenseless against such a threat.

&gt; [[Brace yourself.]]
&gt; [[Introduce yourself to the bird.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Brace yourself." tags="" position="965,1223" size="100,100">You freeze. The bird makes a quick peck at your abdomen. Did it just... taste you? It pecks a few more times. _Peck, peck, peck._ The pecking sensation is starting to hurt.

After several more pecks, something completely unexpected occurs: the bird gags. You probably aren't the most attractive prey available, you'll admit that, yet you can't help but feel mildly insulted by this haughty bird's reaction.

The bird continues to gag until it ultimately flies away. Hooray! Saved by your yuckiness. 

&gt; [[Eat more.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Introduce yourself to the bird." tags="" position="1205,1223" size="100,100">scaredBird: true
--
You stand up on your long abdomen and extend your limbs, hoping the bird will interpret this as a universal gesture of friendship. 

It does not. Your action appears to have _frightened_ the bird. It immediately lets out a shrill cry and flies away twice faster than it approached. 

You return to all-sixes and think about what just happened. How could you, a squishy, harmless kid, frighten a gigantic predator like that?

&gt; [[Eat more.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Eat more." tags="" position="1079,1399" size="100,100">energy: energy + 1

[if energy &lt; 3]
Nothing is making sense, except that you're still hungry. You must eat.

So you have another leaf from the plant. You are quickly plumping up, but for some reason you _desire_ to keep eating and growing.

&gt; [[Eat more.]]
&gt; [[Stop eating.]] 

[if energy &gt;= 3 &amp;&amp; energy &lt;= 5]
You eat another leaf and continue to grow. 

&gt; [[Eat more.]]
&gt; [[Stop eating.]] 

[if energy === 6]
Suddenly you notice a smaller creature scurrying near you. How long its been there, you can't tell. 

The creature, like you, is irregularly proportioned, though its three body sections are more clearly segmented than yours. Its chest similarly has three pairs of limbs, though they are relatively longer than yours considering the creature's size. Jutting from its head are two hairy tentacles that flail about like extra limbs. The creature's jaws consist of a pair of oversized, scimitar-shaped pincers angling inward toward its mouth. You wonder how this tiny thing can manage to hold them up so effortlessly.

Then it hits you: this "creature" is just an ant! 

If it were any larger, the ant would probably be even more intimidating than the bird. However, it's so small that you view it as kind of cute... or perhaps tasty?

The ant doesn't appear to be even remotely interested in you. In fact it appears to be lost.

&gt; [[Eat the ant.]]
&gt; [[Greet the ant.]]

[if energy &gt; 6]
You can't bring yourself to eat another leaf. Your body simply won't allow it.

&gt; [[Stop eating.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Stop eating." tags="" position="1079,1586" size="100,100">You muster enough willpower to stop eating, if only for a moment's reflection.

How much time has passed since you began eating? What a monster you must be, to consume so much without any hesitation... and for what?

It is abundantly clear to you that you are no longer {playerName}. The alien-like body proportions, the six limbs attached to your chest, the weakened vision, the insatiable hunger for leaves. Nothing is as it was. But if you are not {playerName}, who are you?

Since recovering from your "accident", you haven't felt much in control of anything you've done. You've been driven by something inexplicable, something internal. A need to eat voraciously, a need to develop. Develop into _what_, exactly? 

Nonstop eating has made you quite exhausted. Perhaps you can sleep all this off.

&gt; [[Prepare to sleep.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Prepare to sleep." tags="" position="1080,1734" size="100,100">You hang upside down by attaching your stubby, sticky abdominal feet to one of the plant's twigs. You don't know why, but this feels like the most comfortable position for sleeping.

For a split second your remember the bird. 

[if scaredBird; append]
You fear some other predator that _doesn't_ find you horrifying will prey on you in your sleep.

[else; append]
You fear some other predator that _doesn't_ find you repulsive will prey on you in your sleep. 

[continue]
You consider your options at this point. 

You are literally "bursting at the seams", to the point where you can shed your thin skin and hopefully become sheltered by whatever is beneath it. 

Or you can begin crafting a cozy blanket around yourself, one strong enough to protect you through the night.

&gt; [[Shed your skin.]]
&gt; [[Make a blanket.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Eat the ant." tags="" position="919,1511" size="100,100">The ant's tentacles flail wildly, which makes you even more interested in learning what it tastes like. Perhaps this is how the bird saw you?

However, the moment you make a move toward it, the ant flees. It's much faster than you, especially now that you've become so large. You'll never be able to catch it.

You wonder what might have happened between you two, had you not been so greedy.

&gt; [[Eat more.]]
&gt; [[Stop eating.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Greet the ant." tags="" position="1242,1501" size="100,100">antFriend: true
--
[if !scaredBird]
You attempt to greet the ant.

[else]
You attempt to greet the ant, but without scaring it off like you did the bird, of course. 

[continue]
No response. It's an ant. Go figure.

&gt; [[Eat more.]] 
&gt; [[Stop eating.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Make a blanket." tags="" position="1215,1883" size="100,100">With your mouth, you begin spinning a silk blanket from your head down to your stubby feet. 

[if energy &lt; 3]
You lack sufficient energy to produce anything substantial, but you suppose something is better than nothing.

[if energy &gt;= 3 &amp;&amp; energy &lt;= 5]
You seem to have just the right amount of energy to produce the ideal blanket. You'll sleep well tonight.

[if energy &gt; 6]
You are so bloated from overeating that you worry you'll fall from the twig! Nevertheless, you're able to create your blanket, albeit not as well as you would have liked.

[continue]
[if antFriend]
Snug in your blanket, you notice the ant is now accompanied by several more of its kind. Who invited them to the sleepover?! You hope they aren't planning to gang up on you while you're sleeping. 

[continue]
It doesn't take long for you to fall soundly asleep. Your blanket is so comfortable you begin to feel as if you're floating in it, like you're made of liquid...

&gt; [[Sleep.-&gt;Awaken.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Shed your skin." tags="" position="955,1883" size="100,100">shedSkin: true
--
As unpleasant as it sounds, the idea of shedding your skin comes naturally to you, just as eating leaves did.

[if energy &lt; 3]
You wish you had eaten more, since the energy required to wiggle out of your skin is more than you possess. You're able to do it, but the process is very demanding.

[if energy &gt;= 3 &amp;&amp; energy &lt;= 5]
You dance and twist your body, causing your skin to fall from you with the greatest of ease.

[if energy &gt; 6]
You've grown so huge that your skin is already beginning to shed, yet this same hugeness makes it difficult for you to maneuver your body skillfully enough to finish the job. Anyway, after much awkward struggling, your skin eventually falls from your body.

[continue]
You hang naked from the twig, but you don't _feel_ naked. You sense that your inner organs are now encased within a rapidly hardening shell, completely unlike the soft, squishy skin you just shed. It's like you're freezing but becoming warmer at the same time.

[if antFriend]
As you doze off, you notice the ant is now accompanied by several more of its kind. Who invited them to the sleepover?! You hope they aren't planning to gang up on you while you're sleeping. 

[continue]
It doesn't take long for you to fall soundly asleep.

&gt; [[Sleep.-&gt;Awaken.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Awaken." tags="" position="1085,2049" size="100,100">config.header.center: ""

You awaken on your feet. You are standing somewhere outdoors.

Standing!

You look below and see arms, legs, shoes - the body of a human being. You're {playerName}!

"Looks like {playerName} is wimping out!" 

Startled, you spin around to find a group of kids about your age, laughing and jeering at you.

"I guess {playerName} was all talk, huh?"

"Yeah. {playerName} isn't one of us. Let's go."

Indignity and desperation swell within you. A plea escapes your mouth.

&gt; [["Wait! I can do it!"-&gt;Face the tree.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Face the tree." tags="" position="1081,2210" size="100,100">"Then stop wasting our time."

You gaze upon a towering tree. You aim your eyes toward its highest branches, eventually focusing on the treasure nestled among them. 

"Climb up there and get it!"

It's funny when you think about it. What began as something meaningless to you is now the most precious thing in your life. It is the key to becoming someone else. Returning with it will prove to everyone that you are-

_ring... ring... ring..._

&gt; [[Fade.-&gt;Fade 2.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Fade 2." tags="" position="1085,2362" size="100,100">You awaken within a cage. Yet you feel mighty, like you could break the cage into pieces without much effort.

So naturally you do so. Afterward you stretch your legs, all six of them, and examine the cage that held you. 

[if shedSkin; append]
It looks oddly familiar, like the form of a creature you're positive you've seen before.

[else; append]
It looks sturdy. You're sure it could withstand any kind of attack.

[continue]
[if antFriend]
Also near the cage you see a dozen or so ants. Obviously these were your prison guards. Well, they can't stop you now. 

[continue]
You pump blood into the limp appendages attached to your back, then spread them open for those nearby to witness. With your exceptionally large eyes, you can definitely see them seeing you.

Once they're sufficiently pumped, you're ready to put those wings of yours to use. 

&gt; [[Take flight.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Take flight." tags="" position="1085,2512" size="100,100">For days you flitter and flutter about, happy with yourself and doing as you please. You explore, drink the nectar of colorful flowers, and befriend others who look like you, all without a care in the world. 

That is, until the giants begin hunting you.

Ah, of course there would be. There _should_ be. Such is the nature of life. 

You fly away as fast as you can, but the giants are persistent. However, they they lack wings, so you can easily evade them by utilizing yours.

You notice a tall tree nearby. Assuming you aren't unwittingly flying into the mouth of another predator, there is your refuge. The branches are so high up that the giants shouldn't be able to reach you.

&gt; [[Fly to the tree.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Fly to the tree." tags="" position="1085,2662" size="100,100">Once atop the tree, you freeze as you behold a menacing bird. It stares at you for a moment, before abruptly fleeing

[if scaredBird; append]
in horror.

[else; append]
in disgust.

[continue]
You find the bird's behavior peculiar. You're thankful, but not for long. When you look down, you see one of the giants beginning to climb the tree while the others holler at it.

There's something curious about the one climbing. The closer it gets to you, the more you hear a ringing sound.

_ring... ring... ring..._

You are disoriented by all the ringing. Before long the giant is close enough that you can see its eyes. You didn't expect them to express fear, however. Can the giant hear the ringing too? 

It extends its hand to you.

&gt; [[Avoid its hand.]]
&gt; [[Land on its hand.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Avoid its hand." tags="" position="943,2820" size="100,100">You deftly avoid the giant's hand and tickle its nose with your wings. This causes it to lose its balance, and you watch as it plummets to the ground. When it lands, its rowdy pack is now uncharacteristically silent. You notice that the constant ringing you heard has also ceased.

&gt; [[Watch.-&gt;Ending 1.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Land on its hand." tags="" position="1226,2817" size="100,100">The moment you land on the  giant's hand, the ringing ceases, as does your consciousness. 

&gt; [[Awaken.-&gt;Ending 2.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Ending 2." tags="" position="1227,3011" size="100,100">You awaken at the base of a towering tree. You are holding a motionless winged creature in your hands. A group of kids form a circle around you.

"You did it {playerName}!"

"Let me see it!"

You offer the creature to one of the kids.

"Wait... is it..."

"No, I think it's just sleeping."

Another kid yanks the creature, places it in a jar, and tightens the lid. The creature still does not stir.

"You gotta poke holes in the lid or it'll-"

"I know, I know!"

The kids walk away from the tree, passing the jar back and forth between them, until of them calls back to you.

"Hey {playerName}! You coming or what?"

Without hesitation, you run to catch up with your friends. 

[align center]
### THE END</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Ending 1." tags="" position="938,3008" size="100,100">You land again on the tree and await the next giant who would attempt to climb. Fortunately, none do.

Instead they flee, leaving the one who fell to fend for itself, which you don't expect will be easy since it is apparently asleep. 

For a moment you feel a slight sense of remorse for the fallen giant, to have been abandoned by its pack like so. Was this beast really one of their kind? If not, what will it be when it awakens?

You descend from the tree and return to flitting and fluttering about, happy with yourself and doing as you please.
